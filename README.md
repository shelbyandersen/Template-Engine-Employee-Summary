# Template-Engine-Employee-Summary

## Description

This project utilizes the CLI to ask a user (manager) specific questions about their employees. After the questions are answered, the information will populate in a final team.html file.

This application utilizes node.js, inquires, fs, and an app.js file that holds the code that contains the questions to ask users and to populate their answers.

There is an output folder in this application. This is where the team.js file will be created (this is the file created once the user answers all the questions prompted).

# Installation

https://github.com/shelbyandersen/Template-Engine-Employee-Summary

# Usage

The Employee Template App uses node.js, inquirer, and fs.

There are a series of tests that must pass before the code can be run. These tests are applied to the html files:

- Employee.html
- Engineer.html
- Intern.html
- Manager.html

The final output is displayed on the team.html file.

Code will need to be taken from the repo on github and changes can be made: https://github.com/shelbyandersen/Template-Engine-Employee-Summary
